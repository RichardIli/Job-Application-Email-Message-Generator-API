    "to": "recipient@example.com",
    "subject": "Test Email from Postman",
    "text": "This is a plain text body.",
    "html": "<h3>This is an HTML body.</h3>"
}
Send the Request: Click the Send button to send the request.

The server will respond with a 200 OK status and the message "Email sent successfully!" if the email is sent successfully.

The server will return a 500 Internal Server Error if there's a problem sending the email.
