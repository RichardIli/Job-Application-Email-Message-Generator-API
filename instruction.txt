Here is how you can make a simple Postman API request to test the composeEmail endpoint, considering the different types of input it can handle.

1. Plain Text Request
This is for when you want to send the job details as a simple text string.

Postman Setup:

Method: POST

URL: http://localhost:3000/compose-email (assuming your server runs on port 3000)

Body: raw -> JSON

Content:

JSON

{
    "jobDetails": "Job Title: Senior Software Engineer\nCompany: Tech Innovations Inc.\nResponsibilities: Develop and maintain web applications. Experience with Node.js and React is required.",
    "notes": "I have experience in both Node.js and React, please highlight this in the email."
}
2. File Upload Request (for PDF, Image, or DOCX)
This is for when you want to upload a job description file.

Postman Setup:

Method: POST

URL: http://localhost:3000/compose-email

Body: form-data

Key-Value Pairs:

Key: jobDetailsFile (This must exactly match the name you defined in upload.single('jobDetailsFile') in your Express server setup).

Value: Select File from the dropdown menu on the right. Then, click "Select File" and choose your PDF, PNG, JPG, or DOCX file.

Key: notes (This is optional).

Value: Type in your additional notes as a text string (e.g., "This job looks great!").

Important Notes:

Server Must Be Running: Make sure your Express server is running before sending the request.

File Field Name: The Key for the file upload (jobDetailsFile) is case-sensitive and must match what you passed to upload.single() in your server code.

No "Content-Type" Header: Postman will automatically set the Content-Type header to multipart/form-data when you use the form-data body type, so you don't need to set it manually.
